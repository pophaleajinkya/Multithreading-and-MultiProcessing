# Introduction to Multithreading and Multiprocessing in Python
# Multithreading
Multithreading is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread runs as a separate entity, allowing tasks to be performed simultaneously. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks such as reading and writing files, handling network connections, and performing web scraping.

# Key Features of Multithreading:
Concurrency: Multiple threads run concurrently, which can lead to more efficient use of resources.
Shared Memory: Threads share the same memory space, making it easy to share data between them.
Lightweight: Threads are lighter than processes, requiring less memory and overhead.

# Multiprocessing
Multiprocessing is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs in its own memory space, providing true parallelism, especially beneficial for CPU-bound tasks like mathematical computations, data processing, and machine learning.

# Key Features of Multiprocessing:
Parallelism: Multiple processes can run on different CPU cores simultaneously, offering true parallel execution.
Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, which prevents memory conflicts but requires inter-process communication for data sharing.
Robustness: Processes are more robust than threads since they are isolated; a crash in one process does not affect others.


# When to Use Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing
Multithreading is ideal for I/O-bound tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for external resources, such as file I/O, network communication, and web scraping.
Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation and can benefit from parallel execution on multiple CPU cores.
Understanding these techniques allows you to write more efficient and effective Python programs by leveraging the power of concurrent and parallel execution.
